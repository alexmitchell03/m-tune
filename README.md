Practice your tuning skills with our Ear Training Game!
From the home html page, select a difficulty (easy, medium, hard)

After selecting a difficulty, you will be directed to a stage where there are slider(s). 
The mouse-controlled slider will allow you to change the pitch of an unknown default frequency. 

Adjust the slider until you think you have matched the Goal/Objective frequency printed on the screen by pressing 
the "confirm" button. 

If you matched the frequency desired, good job!
If not, you will be prompted with how much you were off by!
